# Password-Breaker
* This program recursively generates all possible combinations of a password using the selected characters. 

* You can modify the characters that are used in the passwords by changing the "characters" variable. 

* The maximum length of the passwords can also be adjusted by changing the "max_length" variable. 

* The program may take a while to run depending on the amount of characters used and the maximum length.
